There are some minor deviations where the predicted prices do not perfectly align with the actual prices. 
These deviations could be due to the inherent volatility of Bitcoin or limitations in the model's ability to capture certain anomalies or sudden market changes.
While the model has its limitations, we can still see the close alignment between actual and predicted prices which suggests that the model performs well overall,
and is capable of providing valuable insights for future price movements.
