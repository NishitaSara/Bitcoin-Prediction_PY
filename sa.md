The system architecture involves several layers: data collection, data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and real-time prediction. Each layer is crucial for the overall functionality, 
enabling the system to collect historical data, preprocess it, train an LSTM model, make predictions, and visualize the results.
The design ensures a structured flow from data collection to model training and finally to making and visualizing predictions.
