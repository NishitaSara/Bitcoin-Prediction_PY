In this mini project, we explored the volatile world of Bitcoin price prediction. 
By leveraging historical price data and various machine learning algorithms, we aimed to create a model that could effectively predict future Bitcoin prices.
We gathered historical Bitcoin price data and used machine learning models and algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. 
Predicting Bitcoin prices is inherently challenging due to the market's high volatility and prone to external factors such as regulatory news, market sentiment, and macroeconomic trends. 
Our model's performance reflects these difficulties, and while it provides valuable insights, it should be used cautiously.
The project successfully demonstrated the potential of machine learning in predicting Bitcoin prices, albeit with some limitations. 
While our model provides a solid foundation, it is essential for traders and investors to combine these insights with a broader market analysis for informed decision-making.
