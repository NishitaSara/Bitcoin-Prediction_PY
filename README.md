# Bitcoin-Prediction_PY

*Problem Statement*
Are machine learning models capable of forecasting the bitcoin market? Unlike traditional paper currency which can be printed as per market needs, Cryptocurrency has a limited supply. 
Should you invest or not? 


The proposed method is written in Python and tested on benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed method can be used to make reliable predictions. 
Thus, the neural network, which has been used by academics in numerous fields over the past ten years as one of the intelligent data mining tools. 
Stock market data is critical in today's economy. 
Linear (AR, MA, ARIMA, ARMA) and nonlinear models are the two types of forecasting methodologies (ARCH, GARCH, Neural Network).
To anticipate a company's stock price based on past prices, we employed the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Recurrent Neural 
Network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit deep learning architectures (GRU
